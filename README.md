# iOS BLE Explorer
A very simple explorer to discover Bluetooth LE peripherals, services and characteristics using Core Bluetooth in iOS

This is a native iOS app written in Swift.

This is useful if you just got a new Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device without specifications and need to find out what services and characteristics it holds.

1. The app will scan for all BLE peripherals around and display them in a table
2. As you tap a device, all its services will be displayed in a new table
3. Finally, as you tap a service, all its characteristics and values will be displayed in a last table

Have a good time!

p.s.: it doesn't work on some iPads and I need to find out why
